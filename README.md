# QBIO7004 - Individual Based Modelling 

### Author:

### Assignment Task:
QBIO7004 students have been assigned the task of developing a new computational model. For this assignment, the model should be a stochastic individual based model relevant to a desired field and needs to address a specific question.

### Aims:
For my project, I aimed to model anemonefish recruitment networks to explore the effects of bleaching events on anemonefish population size. This is in light of the increase in bleaching events, which are forecast to increase in frequency and intensity. 

### Model Functions:

The model contains 7 functions which simulate the following events: 

1. Inital anemonefish population 
2. Egg production 
3. Larvae
4. Recruits
5. Juveniles 
6. Adults
7. Bleaching event 

Further details on the operations of each function can be found in the report.

### Repository Folder Structure:
```
code # folder containing all the code to run the model 
figs # folder containing the figures to show the output of the model
ppt # contains the powerpoint presentation
report # folder containing the .Rmd and .html final report files 
```
